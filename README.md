## Datasets

The application uses four heart disease datasets sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

- **Cleveland**
- **Switzerland**
- **Hungary**
- **VA Long Beach**

These datasets include 13 health metrics per patient and a target variable indicating heart disease presence. They are combined to form a robust training set for the machine learning model.

## Machine Learning Model

The prediction model employs a sophisticated pipeline:
- **Data Scaling:** Standardizes features for consistency.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** Reduces dimensionality while preserving 95% of variance.
- **Ensemble Classifier:** Integrates Random Forest and Gradient Boosting with soft voting for improved accuracy.

The model is trained on 80% of the data and validated on the remaining 20%, enabling reliable predictions for new inputs with probability scores.

## Visualizations

The Dashboard provides an array of interactive plots:
- **Prediction Distribution:** Bar and pie charts of risk predictions.
- **Age vs Maximum Heart Rate:** Scatter plot with trendlines showing risk correlations.
- **Cholesterol Distribution:** Box plots by risk category.
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Feature correlation visualization.
- **PCA Visualization:** 2D scatter plot of PCA-transformed data.
- **Source Comparison:** Histograms and box plots across datasets.
- **Feature Distributions:** Histograms of key metrics by source.
- **Model Performance:** Includes confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance, and classification report.

These visualizations offer intuitive insights into the data and model behavior.

## Prediction

The Prediction section allows users to:
- **Input Health Metrics:** Provide values for age, sex, chest pain type, etc.
- **Receive Assessment:** Get a "Low Risk" or "High Risk" result with a probability score.
- **Feedback:** Experience audio cues and animations (e.g., heartbeat for high risk, balloons for low risk).

## Input Guide

The Prediction Inputs Guide offers:
- **Definition:** What each metric means.
- **Relevance:** Its importance to heart disease.
- **Guidance:** How to measure or estimate it.
- **Examples:** Practical illustrations.

This ensures users can confidently provide accurate inputs.
